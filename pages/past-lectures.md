## 2019-2020 Colloquium Series

### Fall 2019

**_Why is it so Difficult to Reduce Community Violence?  The Challenges of Street Culture, Delinquent Peer Networks and Gangs_**<br>

Although long-term, national trends in violent crime indicate we are at historic lows, some urban neighborhoods, such as those in North Philadelphia, still suffer from disproportionately high levels of shootings and violence. Crime reduction initiatives come and go, with little dent in the homicide numbers. This presentation will outline the challenges facing urban neighborhoods where the street code of violence is high and youth often remain loyal to their anti-social peers. The presentation draws on a study with Philadelphia street gang members that sought to understand the dynamics of street crime and group violence, and how social networks might impede or facilitate withdrawal from crime and gangs. The presentation will also discuss the study’s implications for policy and practice.

**_A Walk in the Park? Challenges to Developing, Managing, and Maintaining Urban Public Spaces for a Just and Equitable City_**<br>

This presentation examines inequities in urban public spaces through a series of questions, including: Do low-income and minority communities have lower levels of access to public spaces than wealthier and/or whiter communities? Are privately owned and/or privately managed public spaces less publicly accessible than publicly owned and managed spaces? What are the primary challenges to overcome to improve public space accessibility?

**November 14, 2019: Fenaba Addo, Department of Consumer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison**<br>
**_Wealth Inequality and the Black Middle Class_**<br>

Fenaba R. Addo, Ph.D. is the Lorna J. Wendt Assistant Professor of Consumer Science at the UW-Madison. She also a faculty affiliate of the Center for Financial Security, Institute for Research on Poverty, Center for Demography and Ecology,  La Follette School of Public Affairs, and Department of Sociology. Her research agenda examines how inequalities in debt and wealth create and recreate family, social, and health inequities. She is also interested the role that consumer and family policies serve in reinforcing these relationships and the consequences for economically vulnerable populations in the U.S., in particular communities of color, young adults, and older women.

**February 13, 2020: Karolyn Tyson, Department of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**<br>
**_Trust in Times of Crisis and Change: Implications for Policy and Practice_**<br>

Karolyn Tyson is Professor and Associate Chair in the Department of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She received a doctorate in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley and a B.A. from Spelman College. Dr. Tyson specializes in qualitative research focused on schools and processes of social inequality. She is particularly interested in understanding the complex relationships between quotidian schooling processes, how people define their experiences, and individual action and outcomes. She is currently working on a book about trust in the aftermath of desegregation. Dr. Tyson is the author of Integration Interrupted: Tracking, Black Students, and Acting White after Brown as well as numerous articles examining the schooling experiences, attitudes, and outcomes of black students.

**_To Trust, or Not to Trust: How the Brain Shapes Social Decisions in Older Adults_**<br>

Older adults are at increased risk for financial exploitation and also age-related health problems, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. Yet, we have little insight into how we can reduce risk of (or delay) the associated cognitive decline and functional impairments, including those associated with vulnerability to financial exploitation. In this talk, I will present some of the ongoing work from my lab that uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the underlying brain mechanisms that shape how older adults make social decisions, particularly those that involve trusting other people. Our goal is to understand how these brain mechanisms are related to financial exploitation and the functional impairments associated with risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. We believe that developing a better understanding of the relations between these factors is an important step toward early identification and creating interventions that might eventually be used to improve outcomes in older adults.

**_Does Money Matter?: Preschool Funding, Program Quality, and Child Development_**<br>

Preschool programs targeted towards low-income children can be effective at narrowing socioeconomic disparities in children’s skills at kindergarten entry, but preschool effectiveness varies widely across centers, potentially due to differences in per-pupil funding. This study investigates the relationships among preschool funding, program quality, and child development, with policy implications for the promotion of kindergarten readiness and expansion of opportunity into adulthood.

**_Protected Spaces: The Rise and Fall of the Public Bathroom in the United States: A Preliminary Research Report_**<br>
Finding a public bathroom in Center City Philadelphia (or any other American city) isn’t easy. Sometimes the absence of a clean and accessible toilet is the punchline of a joke, but other times it is something far more menacing, like when two Black men asked to use the Starbucks bathroom near Rittenhouse Square and ended up in handcuffs and then on the nightly news. 

“America,” NYU sociologist and toilet scholar Harvey Molotch told the Washington Post after that Starbucks moment in 2017, “has a public bathroom problem.”

But the US didn’t always have this problem. In the early years of the 20th C., cities from Philadelphia to York, PA to Lincoln, NE to San Francisco built public bathrooms. And these weren’t just metal stalls and sinks with concrete floors. They were “comfort stations.” Local officials bragged about the size, central location, and brass and marble finishes of these facilities. At one point, the New York Subway system had more than 700 public bathrooms. Today there are less than twenty and most of them are locked up tight or hidden from sight. 

So what happened? Why did US policy makers tear down what they had once built? What does this officially sanctioned, systematic destruction of these key pieces of the urban “social infrastructure” tell us about governance, about race, class, and gender, about bodies and able-ness, about notions of privacy and public-ness, about what cities will fund and what they won’t support, about equal access to the public realm, and about the very day practice of inclusion and democracy? 

These are the questions driving my current project, and there is perhaps no better way to get at them than through the public bathroom, and that is because there is, I would suggest, quite literally no way to have access to public space (bowling alleys, third places, or cosmopolitan canopies) without access to a public bathroom.

**_When Do Reformer District Attorneys Run and Win?_**<br>
Several large cities have elected district attorneys committed to using the power of the office to reduce mass incarceration. While there has been a good deal of journalistic attention to the small number of cases where these reformers win office, we know little about the reasons why these reformers win office, and we know even less about cases where reformers run, but don't win. In this talk, I present preliminary evidence on the prevalence of reformer district attorneys as winners and losers in the largest jurisdictions in recent election cycles. I will also discuss the correlates of reformers' electoral entry and electoral success. These results have implications for the efficacy of “bottom-up” efforts at reforming criminal justice policy.

**_Abolition Policy and the Long Movement for Black Lives_**<br>
Although police abolition is gaining new traction in the US policy arena, everyday practices of living beyond policing have always shaped communities located at the margins of US society. This presentation draws on research in historically Black communities in the United States shaped by longstanding challenges to policing. The long movement for Black survival and abolition offers grounded evidence of the possibility of a world beyond policing that an ever-growing group of scholars, political organizers, and now policymakers are calling for.
